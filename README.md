#WebsiteCountdownTimer

This is a website I created in anticipation for a trip to NY. This website is built to be run and hosted on the Raspberry Pi 3. Utilizes unix cron job to run a python script each day to replace the photo. Also utilizes the lightbox photo viewer [Fancybox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/) to display daily photo. Python script is in the root directory of this repository.
